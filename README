WHAT IT IS:
If you are a developer you probably need to test your craft on a stable browser. You know, the ones normal customers use.

But if you are a developer, you probably want to test your skills against the latest and greatest version of chrome or maybe just play with the hottest toys.

This script will allow you to pull in the latest Chromium nightly build so you don't have to backup your data and switch channels each time you need to switch.

HOW TO USE:
To implement, save chromium-nightly.sh someplace accessible.

Register the bash command (chmod u+x chromium-nightly.sh)

The script takes up to 2 [optional] arguments:

1) the subdirectory in your /home/Applications directory [OPTIONAL]

or 2) your OS (if not mac or linux: i.e., 'linux' if you are on FreeBSD, etc.) -- sorry Windows, 64-bit and other "fringe" users. #FAIL [LARGELY UNNECESSARY]

The script first sniffs the platform. If it does not match Linux or Darwin (OS X.*) it will check for the OS argument (needs to be second if you specify an Application subdir)

Let me know if something don't work (I need to get back to JSConf2011)
