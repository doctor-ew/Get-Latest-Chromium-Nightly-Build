WHAT IT IS:
If you are a developer you probably need to test your craft on a stable browser. You know, the ones normal customers use.

But if you are a developer, you probably want to test your skills against the latest and greatest version of chrome or maybe just play with the hottest toys.

This script will allow you to pull in the latest Chromium nightly build so you don't have to backup your data and switch channels each time you need to switch.

HOW TO USE:
To implement, save chromium-nightly.sh someplace accessible.

Register the bash command (chmod u+x chromium-nightly.sh)

The script takes 2 arguments: 1) your OS (mac or linux) -- sorry Windows users. #FAIL

and 2) the subdirectory in your /home/Applications directory 

From there, the script will access the corresponding chromium repository.

Let me know if something don't work (I need to get back to JSConf2011)
